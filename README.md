# downloads_tickets_sorter
Python script for sorting files out of my downloads directory.

Python script that I made to automatically sort my downloads folder for any of my tickets that I've closed. It will look through the directory, find the file that meets the requirement and then sort it into the proper directory. If the directory doesn't exist then it will create the directory and move the file there.
